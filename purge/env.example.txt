# ============================================================
# Batch Control Settings
# ============================================================

# Number of questions to process per batch
# Default: 5
# Recommended for testing: 2-3
# Recommended for production: 5-10
BATCH_SIZE=5

# Maximum number of batches to process
# Leave commented out or remove for unlimited (process all questions)
# Set to a number to limit processing (useful for testing/cost control)
# Examples:
#   MAX_BATCHES=1   → Process only 1 batch (e.g., 5 questions if BATCH_SIZE=5)
#   MAX_BATCHES=2   → Process only 2 batches (e.g., 10 questions if BATCH_SIZE=5)
#   MAX_BATCHES=10  → Process only 10 batches (e.g., 50 questions if BATCH_SIZE=5)

# Uncomment the line below to enable batch limiting:
# MAX_BATCHES=2


# ============================================================
# Training Context Optimization
# ============================================================

# Include training context in all batches or only the first one?
# false (default) = Only first batch gets full training context (~80K tokens)
#                   Subsequent batches get a reference message (~100 tokens)
#                   ✅ Saves ~80K tokens per batch (recommended for cost savings)
#                   ✅ Allows processing multiple batches simultaneously
# true = All batches get full training context
#        ⚠️  Uses ~80K extra tokens per batch (more expensive)
#        ⚠️  May hit queue limits faster
#        ✅ May improve quality for complex logic

INCLUDE_TRAINING_IN_ALL=false


# ============================================================
# Multi-Agent Configuration (multiagentic.py only)
# ============================================================

# Maximum number of feedback loops
# The Reviewer will check outputs and provide feedback up to this many times
# Default: 5
MAX_FEEDBACK_LOOPS=5

# Maximum number of questions to process (for testing)
# Set to 0 or leave blank to process all questions
# Set to a number to limit (e.g., MAX_QUESTIONS=5 processes only first 5 questions)
# Useful for quick testing without processing entire file
MAX_QUESTIONS=


# ============================================================
# Efficient Batch Pipeline Overrides (multiagentic_batch_efficient.py)
# Prefix: EFF_
# ============================================================

# Batch size override for efficient pipeline (falls back to BATCH_SIZE if empty)
EFF_BATCH_SIZE=

# Include training in all batches for efficient pipeline
# true/false (falls back to INCLUDE_TRAINING_IN_ALL if empty)
EFF_INCLUDE_TRAINING_IN_ALL=

# Max completion tokens for transformer in efficient pipeline
# e.g., 6000, 10000, 16000

# Max completion tokens for reviewer in efficient pipeline
EFF_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS_REVIEWER=

# Max training context tokens to load for efficient pipeline

# Optional: limit number of batches to process in efficient pipeline

# ============================================================
# Input File Configuration
# ============================================================

# Specific input file to process (optional)
# If set, only this file will be processed instead of all files in generation/
# Example: INPUT_FILE_NAME=R79550.md
# Leave empty to process all files
INPUT_FILE_NAME=

# ============================================================
# Usage Examples
# ============================================================

# Example 1: Testing with minimal processing (5 questions)
# BATCH_SIZE=5
# MAX_BATCHES=1

# Example 2: Cost control (process 25 questions)
# BATCH_SIZE=5
# MAX_BATCHES=5

# Example 3: Full production (process all questions)
# BATCH_SIZE=5
# MAX_BATCHES is not set

# Example 4: Quick iteration (process 2 questions)
# BATCH_SIZE=2
# MAX_BATCHES=1

# Example 5: Process specific file
# INPUT_FILE_NAME=R79550.md
# BATCH_SIZE=5
