For example, create temporary copies of each A1x1_* cell, set the temp to 0 (or system-missing) when the original is in (97,98,99), then compute sumA1x1 from the temps. Example approach: DO REPEAT x = A1x1_51 A1x1_1 ... A1x1_9 / tx = t_A1x1_51 t_A1x1_1 ... t_A1x1_9. COMPUTE tx = x. IF tx IN (97,98,99) tx = 0. END REPEAT.

For the OE-negative case, use a clear condition such as: sel if flt_A1x1 = 1 and (missing(A1x1_9) or A1x1_9 = 0) and (not (A1x1_9 IN (97,98,99))) and (not missing(A1x1_9_other) and TRIM(A1x1_9_other) <> ''). This is clearer and avoids fragile chained equality expressions.", "Optional: If the intended behavior is that special codes should also be exempt from per-cell range checks, explicitly exclude them from the range test (e.g., if flt_A1x1 = 1 and not missing(x) and not (x IN (97,98,99)) and ~range(x,0,999) flag = 1)."]}
